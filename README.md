# hello-world
Just another repository

Learning how to use Github for the very first time. At first glance, Github seems daunting with all the different tools one can use, but it I have realized it just makes sense. Very intuitive features. I really appreciate the main and branch functions, which is basic but this feature alone would have made life easier during my senior design project.
